# GNNRank

This is a fork of the the [official code repo](https://github.com/SherylHYX/GNNRank) for the ICML 2022 paper -- [GNNRank: Learning Global Rankings from Pairwise Comparisons via Directed Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00211.pdf).

The objective of this fork is to make the code more accessible for integration in other projects. We refactored the `Trainer` class in `/src/Trainer.py` to supply individual methods for init, training, prediction, and evaluation. `/src/run.py` is a drop-in replacement for `/src/train.py` to run a full lifecycle of training and evaluation (see examples below).

## Environment Setup
### Overview
<!-- The underlying project environment composes of following componenets: -->
The project has been tested on the following environment specification:
1. Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Other x86_64 based Linux distributions should also be fine, such as Fedora 32)
2. Nvidia Graphic Card (NVIDIA Tesla T4 with driver version 450.142.00) and CPU (Intel Core i7-10700 CPU @ 2.90GHz)
3. Python 3.7 (and Python 3.6.12)
4. CUDA 11.3 (and CUDA 9.2)
5. Pytorch 1.10.1 (built against CUDA 11.0) and Pytorch 1.8.0 (build against CUDA 10.2)
6. Other libraries and python packages (See below)

### Installation method 1 (.yml files)
You should handle (1),(2) yourself. For (3), (4), (5) and (6), we provide a list of steps to install them.

<!-- We place those python packages that can be easily installed with one-line command in the requirement file for `pip` (`requirements_pip.txt`). For all other python packages, which are not so well maintained by [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), and all C/C++ libraries, we place in the conda requirement file (`requirements_conda.txt`). Therefore, you need to run both conda and pip to get necessary dependencies. -->

We provide three examples of envionmental setup, one with CUDA 10.2 and GPU, one with CUDA 11.3 and GPU, and one with CPU.

Following steps assume you've done with (1) and (2).
1. Install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Both Miniconda and Anaconda are OK.

2. Create an environment and install python packages (GPU, CUDA 10.2):
```
conda env create -f environment_GPU.yml
```

 OR: Create an environment and install python packages (GPU, CUDA 11.3):
```
conda env create -f environment_cuda11.yml
```

 OR: Create an environment and install python packages (CPU):
```
conda env create -f environment_CPU.yml
```


### Installation method 2 (manual installation)
The codebase is implemented in Python 3.6.12. package versions used for development are below.
```
networkx           2.6.3
tqdm               4.62.3
numpy              1.20.3
pandas             1.3.4
texttable          1.6.4
latextable         0.2.1
scipy              1.7.1
argparse           1.1.0
scikit-learn       1.0.1

torch-scatter      2.0.9
pyg                2.0.3 (follow https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)
sparse             0.13.0
```

### Execution checks
When installation is done, you could check you enviroment via:
```
cd execution
bash setup_test.sh
```

## Folder structure
- ./execution/ stores files that can be executed to generate outputs. For vast number of experiments, we use [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/), which can be downloaded in command line and make it executable via:
```
wget http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/parallel.git/plain/src/parallel
chmod 755 ./parallel
```

- ./joblog/ stores job logs from parallel. 
You might need to create it by 
```
mkdir joblog
```

- ./Output/ stores raw outputs (ignored by Git) from parallel.
You might need to create it by 
```
mkdir Output
```

- ./data/ stores processed data sets.

- ./src/ stores files to train various models, utils and metrics.

- ./result_arrays/ stores results for different data sets. Each data set has a separate subfolder.

- ./result_anlysis/ stores notebooks for generating result plots or tables.

- ./logs/ stores trained models and logs, as well as predicted clusters (optional). When you are in debug mode (see below), your logs will be stored in ./debug_logs/ folder.

## Options
<p align="justify">
GNNRank provides various command line arguments, which can be viewed in the ./src/param_parser.py. Some examples are:

```


## Reproduce results
First, get into the ./execution/ folder:
```
cd execution
```
To reproduce basketball results executed on CUDA 1.
```
bash basketball1.sh
```
To reproduce results on synthetic data.
```
bash 0ERO.sh
```
Other execution files are similar to run.

Note that if you are operating on CPU, you may delete the commands ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=xx". You can also set you own number of parallel jobs, not necessarily following the j numbers in the .sh files.

You can also use CPU for training if you add ``--no-duca", or GPU if you delete this.

## Direct execution with training files

Then, below are various options to try:

Creating a GNNRank model for animal data using DIGRAC as GNN, also produce results on syncRank.
```
python ./run.py --all_methods DIGRAC syncRank --dataset animal
```
Creating a GNNRank model for ERO data using both DIGRAC and ib as GNN with 350 nodes, using 0.05 as learning rate.
```
python ./run.py --N 350 --all_methods DIGRAC ib --lr 0.05
```
Creating a GNNRank model for basketball data in season 2010 using all baselines excluding mvr, also save predicted results.
```
python ./run.py --dataset basketball --season 2010 -SP --all_methods baselines_shorter
```
Creating a model for HeadToHead data set with specific number of trials, hidden units and use CPU.
```
python ./run.py --dataset HeadToHead --no-cuda --num_trials 5 --hidden 8
```

## Notes
- For certain applications such as financial data sets, the original adjacency matrices might be skew-symmetric with negative edge weights. For our models here, however, we need to preprocess the data so that we only keep the positive edge weights, as our current pipeline, including the loss functions, are restricted to directed unsigned networks as inputs.
